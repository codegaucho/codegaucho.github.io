Recently I had a website of mine (deanlab.com) die because MongoLab had upgraded to MongoDb 3 and I had not kept up with the times.  Trying to reconstruct what I had done years ago was a challenge.  Just going to dump some of the setup here for future reference.

database: MongoLab
application server: Heroku
image services: Cloudinary

written in node.js, express, Jade
