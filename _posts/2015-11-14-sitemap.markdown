For better search results and such, we wanted to include a sitemap.xml (of course). There is a gem plugin for this that is supposed to work just fine on ghpages.  I added this to my config, and it built a sitemap.xml as advertised, but two issues

- the urls generated for my custom collections were not correct
- it does not generate any of the other nodes (last mod, change frequency, and priority)

Luckily, it is pretty easy to use liquid to loop through the documents in the site and build a sitemap very similar to how we generate our rss feed.
